## App management

### Display notifications for the Company Portal app on Windows<!-- 1808082  -->
We'll update the Company Portal app on Windows devices to display toast notifications to users, even when the application is closed. The update will show notifications for available apps only when the installation status is completed or failed. The Company Portal app won't show notifications for required applications. 

### Display installation status messages for the Company Portal app<!-- 2514416  -->
The Company Portal app will show additional app installation status messages to end users. The following conditions will apply to new Win32 dependency features:
- App failed to install. Dependencies defined by the admin were not met.

### Retarget web clips to Microsoft Edge on iOS devices<!-- 5455276 -->
Web clips, which act as pinned web apps on iOS devices, will need to be updated. Newly deployed web clips will open in Microsoft Edge instead of the Intune Managed Browser if required to open in a protected browser. You must retarget pre-existing web clips to ensure they open in Microsoft Edge instead of the Managed Browser.

### macOS Company Portal user experience improvements<!-- 5568987 -->
We are making improvements to the macOS device enrollment experience and the Company Portal app for Mac. You can expect the following:
- A better Microsoft **AutoUpdate** experience during enrollment that will ensure your users have the latest version of the Company Portal.
- An enhanced compliance check step during enrollment.
- Support for copied Incident IDs, so your users can send errors from their devices to your company support team faster.

For more information about enrollment and the Company Portal app for Mac, see Enroll your macOS device using the Company Portal app (https://docs.microsoft.com/intune-user-help/enroll-your-device-in-intune-macos-cp).

It stays connected even when moving between networks or restarting devices.

On iOS, always-on VPN is limited to IKEv2 profiles.

## Monitoring and troubleshooting

### Improved Intune reporting experience<!-- 3791418 idready -->
Intune now provides an improved reporting experience, including new report types, better report organization, more focused views, improved report functionality, as well as more consistent and timely data. The reporting experience will move from public preview to GA (general availability). Additionally, the GA release will provide localization support, bug fixes, design improvements, and aggregate device compliance data on tiles in the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431).

New report types focus on the following:

- **Organizational** - Provides an broader summary of the overall state.
- **Historical** - Provides patterns and trends over a period of time.
- **Specialist** - Allows you to use raw data to create your own custom reports.

The first set of new reports focuses on device compliance. For more information, see [Blog - Microsoft Intune reporting framework](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/New-Reporting-Framework-Coming-to-Intune/ba-p/1009553) and [Intune reports](~/fundamentals/reports.md).
