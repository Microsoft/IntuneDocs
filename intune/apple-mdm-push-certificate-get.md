# Get an Apple MDM push certificate

[!INCLUDE[azure_portal](./includes/azure_portal.md)]

Intune enables mobile device management (MDM) of iPads, iPhones, and Mac computers and gives users access to company email and apps. An MDM Push certificate is required for Intune to manage iOS and Mac devices. After you add the certificate to Intune, your users can install the Company Portal app to enroll their devices. You can also set up corporate-owned iOS device management with Apple's Device Enrollment Program or enroll devices using Apple Configurator, for example. For more information about enrollment options, see [Choose how to enroll iOS devices](enrollment-method-choose-ios.md).

## Steps to get your certificate
In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose **Device enrollment** > **Apple Enrollment**  **On the Apple MDM Push Certificate tile, Click to setuop**, and then follow these steps in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

**Step 1. Download the Intune certificate signing request required to create an Apple MDM push certificate.**<br>
Select **Download your CSR** to download and save the request file locally. The file is used to request a trust relationship certificate from the Apple Push Certificates Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> The certificate is associated with the Apple ID used to create it. As a best practice, use a company Apple ID for management tasks. Never use a personal Apple ID.

**Step 3. Enter the Apple ID used to create your Apple MDM push certificate.**<br>
Record this ID as a reminder for when you need to renew this certificate.

**Step 4. Browse to your Apple MDM push certificate to upload.**<br>
Go to the certificate (.pem) file, choose **Open**, and then choose **Upload**. With the push certificate, Intune can enroll and manage Apple devices.

## Renew Apple MDM push certificate
The Apple MDM push certificate is valid for one year and must be renewed annually to maintain iOS and macOS device management. If your certificate expires, enrolled Apple devices cannot be contacted.

The certificate is associated with the Apple ID used to create it. Renew the MDM push certificate with the same Apple ID used to create it.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), choose **Device enrollment** > **Apple Enrollment**, and then choose **Apple MDM Push Certificate**.
2. Choose **Download your CSR** to download and save the request file locally. The file is used to request a trust relationship certificate from the Apple Push Certificates Portal.
3. Select **Create your MDM push Certificate** to go to the Apple Push Certificates Portal. Find the certificate you want to renew and select **Renew**.
4. On the **Renew Push Certificate** screen, provide notes to help you identify the certificate in the future, select **Choose File** to browse to the new request file you downloaded, and choose **Upload**.
   > [!TIP]
   > A Certificate can be identified by its UID. Examine the **Subject ID** in the certificate details to find the GUID portion of the UID. Or, on an enrolled iOS device, go to **Settings** > **General** > **Device** **Management** > **Management Profile** > **More Details** > **Management Profile**. The second line item, **Topic**, contains the unique GUID that you can match up to the certificate in the Apple Push Certificates portal.
 
6. On the **Confirmation** screen, select **Download** and save the .pem file locally.
7. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the **Apple MDM push certificate** browse icon, select the .pem file downloaded from Apple, and choose **Upload**.

Your Apple MDM push certificate appears **Active** and has 365 days until expiration.
